# Project 1

Create a Python file named *animal.py*. Be sure to use all lower case letters,
because most things in programming are case sensitive. **A**nimal.py is very
different from **a**nimal.py.

Type (please don't copy and paste - exercise your fingers) the following code
into your *animal.py* file, but with _your name_, _your GitHub username_, and
the _current date_:

```
# Author: Bentley Saunders Harrison Matthews
# GitHub username: Ratta
# Date: 01/01/2020
# Description: Asks the user for their favorite animal and then prints out that
               that is their favorite animal

fave_animal = input("Please enter your favorite animal: ")
print("Your favorite animal is the " + fave_animal + ".")
```

Now save the file (_File - Save All_) and run it. The program should ask you to
enter the name of your favorite animal, and after you do, it will print out
"Your favorite animal is the \<whatever you typed\>."

Once you've verified that your program runs correctly, commit and push your work.
Then go to Gradescope and submit your *animal.py* file from your GitHub repository.
