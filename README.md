Project 1
Create a Python file named animal.py. Be sure to use all lower case letters, because most things in programming are case sensitive. Animal.py is very different from animal.py.

Type (please don't copy and paste - exercise your fingers) the following code into your animal.py file, but with your name, your GitHub username, and the current date:

# Author: Bentley Saunders Harrison Matthews
# GitHub username: Ratta
# Date: 01/01/2020
# Description: Asks the user for their favorite animal and then prints out that
               that is their favorite animal

fave_animal = input("Please enter your favorite animal: ")
print("Your favorite animal is the " + fave_animal + ".")
Now save the file (File - Save All) and run it. The program should ask you to enter the name of your favorite animal, and after you do, it will print out "Your favorite animal is the <whatever you typed>."

Once you've verified that your program runs correctly, commit and push your work. Then go to Gradescope and submit your animal.py file from your GitHub repository.
